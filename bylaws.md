<h2 class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">CONSTITUTION</h2>

#### Article I. Name and Affiliation
1. The name of the organization shall be “Democratic Socialists of O‘ahu”, hereafter referred to as “DSO”.
2. DSO shall be the Democratic Socialists of America chapter for the entirety of the island of Oʻahu.

#### Article II. Purpose and Mission Statement
1. Our mission is to aid in educating, organizing, and liberating the people and ʻāina of Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina and to play a helpful and principled role in the movement for liberation throughout Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina and the world. Within and throughout this struggle, we will articulate, defend, and advance the idea that liberation is impossible under capitalism and de facto political attachment to the United States of America. We seek to help effect change which would extend democracy into all aspects of life—social, political, economic, and environmental. This is the struggle for socialism. Our vision of socialism is profoundly democratic, feminist, de-colonial, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist.

#### Article VII. Powers
1. General Body Meetings (GBMs) are the highest decision-making body of DSO, and are where votes for priority campaigns, SC elections, DSA Convention delegate elections, the adoption of DSO’s platform, and the adoption of amendments to the Constitution will take place.
   - Unless otherwise provided in these bylaws, decisions of DSO shall be made by a simple majority of those present and voting, with those abstaining from the vote not figuring into the determination of the majority required.
   - For purposes of any vote, the determination of the current eligible voting membership shall be a private ballot (likely a folded index card or piece of paper). Votes will be counted immediately by the SC in the presence of members.
2. The SC is tasked with executing the decisions of GBMs and providing political leadership to DSO. The SC is tasked with the every-day work of running DSO and organizing events. Votes by the SC should take place at weekly meetings, or at special meetings when decisions need to be made quickly in response to current events.
   - Decisions made by the SC can be overruled by a simple majority vote of the GBM.
   - Any official and nonsecure Steering Committee communications must be made visible to the general membership at the request of any member. Secure communications require a majority vote at a GBM to be accessed by general membership.
3. The GBM may create temporary Working Groups (WGs) to accomplish particular projects or specialized tasks. The WGs can make everyday decisions regarding the practical tasks of their work, or make proposals or suggestions about our political orientation, but they are ultimately accountable to the GBM and have no formal decision making power.
   - To create a WG, any member in good standing can draft a written proposal outlining the type of work which would be conducted and justifying the need for a dedicated WG. This proposal must be sent to membership at least one week before the next GBM.
   - The creation of a WG can be approved by a simple majority vote of the GBM.
   - The Steering Committee will appoint a Chair or Co-Chairs of the WG, who can be any member in good standing, including SC members. Typically the member who proposed the creation of the WG should be among those appointed to lead the WG.
      - Leadership of a WG is not a SC position.
   - Upon their creation, Working Groups are empowered to have:
     - Regular meetings, open to all members to attend.
     - A dedicated channel in the chapter communications channel.
     - Regular reports and calls to action during SC meetings and GBMs.
   - Working Groups will be chartered to exist for one (1) quarter, or until the end of the next quarter in which it was proposed. After this point, the SC may vote on whether to extend their charter for further semesters or dissolve the WG.
4. The Chapter shall operate as a non-profit association and no profits may accrue to any individual within the organization.
5. The rules contained in the current edition of Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised shall govern the Chapter in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not inconsistent with this Constitution or the Bylaws or standing rules of the organization.

#### Article VIII. Amendment of Bylaws
1. These bylaws may be amended at any GBM of the organization by a two-thirds vote, provided that the amendment has been submitted in writing to the Steering Committee at the previous Steering Committee meeting.

#### Article IX. Harassment Policy
1. The chapter grievance process, including the process for reporting, remedies, and penalties, will be based on Resolution 33 passed by the DSA Convention.
2. Members will be held accountable to the DSO Code of Conduct:
   - Be in general agreement with the principles outlined in the DSA Platform, if not every single policy, and oppose capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and all other forms of oppression.
   - Engage fellow members with respect without using personal attacks or language which discriminates based on identity.
   - Respect the personal boundaries and consent of all people.
3. Grievances should be reported to the Steering Committee. Any involved Steering Committee members in the grievance in question shall recuse themselves until the grievance is resolved.
   - The SC reserves the right to make temporary decisions regarding the attendance of members accused of misconduct to any and all DSA meetings and events, and must initiate a grievance process within one (1) week of this decision having been made, which will be decided by a simple SC majority.
   - SC members shall not individually engage with the accused regarding the decisions of the SC.
4. The SC will regularly inform members of the existence and purpose of the grievance process, as well as how to submit a grievance, during GBMs. They will also regularly discuss the DSO Code of Conduct with members.
5. Members of the SC reserve the right to remove any non-members from the chapter communications channel or ask them not to attend our events if they engage in disruptive behavior, without the necessity of a grievance process.

#### Article X. Dissolution Clause
1. Should the organization be dissolved due to lack of interest or other reasons, it is the responsibility of the current president to notify membership that they have disbanded and provide reason. The treasurer is responsible for ensuring all fundraising dollars go to Democratic Socialists of America and notifying the membership that any allocated funding left will not be used.

#### Article XI. Secession Clause
1. Given the occupation, colonization, and militarization of Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina by the United States of America, DSO shall secede from the National DSA in the event that the National DSA adopts positions and/or takes actions deemed by DSO to be contrary to the interest of the people and the ʻāina of Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina. Secession would require a two-thirds (⅔) majority vote at a GBM with quorum participating.
