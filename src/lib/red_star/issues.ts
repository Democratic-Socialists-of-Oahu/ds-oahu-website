					'The Trump administration is making explicitly clear the war the ruling class has waged on the working people and the death of the social services 20th century socialist and anti-racist organizing has produced. While these programs have been weakened and subject to alt-right racist fearmongering, they still safeguard thousands of working people in Hawaiʻi alone from hunger. Hunger exists under capitalism as a tool of economic coercion: it forces everyone to work and produce profit for the bosses rather than providing for ourselves and our community. Our long term solution is socialism, but in the meanwhile it is our practice to support existing people- serving institutions.',

				`Queer people are under attack. Not just what we see in the news: the hate crimes, open discrimination, and horrible representation in mainstream culture. We feel it in our personal lives. Violations for uniform guidelines, constant misgenderings, mental illness, unemployment, and just a general feeling of insecurity. We should do something about it. We need to have a clear picture of what it means to be queer under capitalism, identify the causes for the issues we face and work tirelessly towards our collective liberation. Queer is not merely a self identity, it is a material class.`,
				`Bell Hooks invokes a specific kind of queerness which is forgotten in capitalist gay culture which reduces queerness to an opt-in identity. The often quoted "Queer, as being about the self which is at odds with everything around it." Queer is queer because there is a constructed normal: a normal constructed and maintained by capitalism. And White-Power Capitalism must condemn that which deviates and defies.`,
				`The violence queer people face is built using both the police in the form of raids and counterinsurgency efforts- but also in the production of a popular culture which encourages violence against queers. This violence is internalized by bigots but it also can be replicated in our own house! Just because someone is queer doesn't mean that they can't also be a rapist.`,
				`Safe nightlife spaces specifically for queer and trans people are so slim it's understandable that there is a push for events to be given the "safe space" label. The failure to consider the underlying capitalist system leaves wide gaps in the construction of "safe spaces". When phrases like "being in community" are used, who are we actually in community with? Is it your queer boss who fired you last week that you made awkward eye contact with at Scarlet? Maybe even your landlord who you run into at the gay bar every now and then? Simply being queer doesn't excuse a capitalist from the violence they enact against other queer and trans working class people every day. The inequalities of living under capitalism don't disappear when you sign onto a list of community agreements.`,
				`Without a mechanism to enforce those community agreements, or the ability to follow up with people before and after the event, they hold zero weight. Truly safe spaces involve the creation of community and solidarity, therefore it requires all participants to know and trust each other, and hold each other accountable for any harm done. It doesn't matter how accepting of gender nonconformity a space or organization is, if they have not put in the work, they cannot be considered "safe".`,
				`The solution then is to get organized! Join an organization and meet other queer people that can provide support for each other. Communication networks that organization provides can alert people to known predators in the community and even use collective power to seek accountability. Above all, your organization should use that collective power to attack the root cause of our oppression: the capitalist system that gives the people that hate us the power to deny us liberation.`

				'The military is giving us antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea (and other STIs)',
				'CW: sex work and trafficking, violence against women',
				'Hawaiʻi has one of the highest rates of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea in the U.S., in no small part due to military personnel and tourism. Hawaiʻi was the first state to identify a strain of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea in the US. Civilian and military populations are surveyed by the Honolulu and Tripler Army Medical Center (AMC) regional laboratories, respectively (1), although the data generated by them are lumped together in national reports (2). As such, it tends to be difficult to find hard numbers about antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea cases in the military, or any STI statistics really, but we can make some assumptions.',
				"The army admits that the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HPV among the military in Hawaiʻi is higher than the national military average, and several times higher than the national average (3,4). A 2018 Department of Defense (DoD) survey of active duty military personnel revealed that a fifth have had more than two sexual partners in the last year, and over a third had sex without protection with a new partner within the past year (5). STI rates increase when military personnel return from deployment, leave, and even long holiday weekends (3). It's not a great leap in logic to conclude that antibiotic-resistant strains of these infections are being spread by the military members treating Hawaiʻi like their personal playground.",
				"Military personnel tend to wait until symptoms appear before getting help, which is a problem when the most common symptom of an STI is no symptoms at all. Coupled with the fact that the DoD doesn't require annual STI screening for men (6), strains of gonorrhea that failed to respond to treatments were identified overseas (7), and the RIMPAC military exercises are next year? There's an antibiotic-resistant powder keg waiting to explode in Hawaiʻi.",
				`The spread of STIs is yet another facet of the violence perpetuated by the military on Hawaiʻi. The government of Hawaiʻi acknowledges that the military enacts violence against women and girls, and RIMPAC exacerbates it even more (8). An Arizona State University study revealed that Hawaiʻi has an "astronomical" demand for sex work compared to other states, and a large number of buyers are from military bases (9). The military fails to confront violence against women by active-duty members, to say nothing of the fact that a disproportionate amount of sex trafficking survivors in Hawaiʻi are Native Hawaiian (10).`,
				"So what are we left with? The military doesn't care about stopping the spread of STIs, only that they aren't impacting their ability to desecrate Hawaiʻi. If you're on the dating apps you know that they're crawling with military personnel, and it seems like if they can't get sex through apps they buy it. They're not getting diagnosed, they're having unprotected sex with multiple partners, and they're spreading antibiotic-resistant STIs. Untreated (or untreatable) STIs can lead to infertility, chronic pain, pregnancy complications, increased risk of HIV infection, and death.",

				`“Cuts”, “Attacks”, “Restrictions”; any word will do to describe how our education system has been screwed and its accessibility strangled since Trump took office. The ability to pursue higher education in any capacity: university, continuation school, even Job Corps— is facing the threat of financial destruction, signaling the decline of education in the U.S. With fewer means to pursue “skilled” labor, people who can't afford university out-of-pocket are corralled into the work force, else they fall into debt. A government that has debt so grand there's a clock dedicated to its infinite rise is not in the business of sparing citizens from financial ruin. Recently, education is seen as worthless unless it sustains capital— otherwise only the cost is left to show for all that intellectual work.`,
				`The recent and most prominent changes to education accessibility are the “Big Beautiful Bill” and Executive Order 14173. Your demographic and class are scrutinized until some reason is found for you to not deserve anything for education, and if a university or program tries to help? Their funding will be slashed. PBS has a collection of stories that detail how the cuts to education have already affected us, and how aid will be distributed in the foreseeable future. The federal Pell Grant and work study are projected to change their criteria, and in the case of work study, have less positions. The usual 12 credits won't qualify for full-time student aid; the new proposed minimum is 15 credits (keep in mind many universities alter tuition cost based on amount of credits taken). As a student, this change will absolutely have negative consequences. I average 15 credits and know people that consistently take 18 – there's a reason most people don't take on that much. Education isn't confined to the hours spent in class and is supposed to be a student's primary concern. Despite this, many students work in addition to their education. If you know anyone who takes on that double life, burnout is common and will become more frequent without student aid. Changes to student life: taking on more classes, more work, more internships, with less aid, less housing, less funding– are destroying what makes an education fulfilling.`,
				`Pairing the knowledge that the average person's debt is the same money used to project what the federal bank should have, with federal financial aid for higher education being cut, leads us to the conclusion that more students will seek out unconventional methods to pay for university. The most common method is “enlist yourself.” We can see who America is attempting to shove into the meat-grinder that is the military industrial complex; the poor, Black, Indigenous, and uneducated. Enlisting is not some insignificant act, it's a subordination to the American empire that contributes to every horror it is capable of no matter what kind of job is taken under it. University is one of the few environments where people can grow their minds and interact with people outside of work and home, it is a pillar of society that cannot be restricted. Even with the “Big Beautiful Bill” that cannot stop the people from educating themselves within their community, and avoiding a blood stained path to achieve that.`

It is high time for us, people of Hawaiʻi, to get the big red target off our back: as long as the United States is in Hawaiʻi, they represent danger to us and the working people of the world.`,
				'It is time for the movement in Hawaiʻi to align with the global masses. Our safety is in struggle for a new Nation, against the Imperialist pigs in D.C. and in Solidarity with the masses in Palestine, the Phillippines, Guåhan, Palau and everywhere the unhinged capitalist class drives the U.S. War Machine.',
				'As this struggle takes form, it is imperative that we both take heed of the spontaneous pressure on the military and get Organized into bodies capable of securing these lands and their cleanup! No New Lease!'

They have to keep up with all the demand somehow.",

You spent money on all this local stuff that every local also wants. It's an exclusive local pattern only available for this local weekend. Is it FOMO for culture or FOMO for capitalism?",

You cannot buy locality clout; you cannot purchase praxis.",

				"For four hours on Wednesday, I felt like I was on the frontlines of an emergency. Throughout the afternoon and evening of July 30, I was working my regular eight hour shift at a grocery store with, suddenly, the added element of impending natural disaster. One moment, my coworker from Mākaha was finishing her shift and saying “I've got to get home,” after the first interval of alarms. Next, I was in charge of twenty-plus people at a time using the self check-out registers while two lines of thirty or more customers waited for the three stations on either side.",
				"When the alert first buzzed on my phone, I felt a wave of anxiety remembering the notable warnings we'd received on Oʻahu in the past; in 2018, a message reading that a nuclear missile was heading straight towards us, and before then the various tsunami warnings that I'd evacuated from with my family as a child. At around 3:30 PM, a tourist family from Spain pulled me aside to ask, “Is this normal here? Should we be scared?”. I told them that it wasn't, and asked where they were staying, which was in Waikīkī. The store I work in is in the Waikīkī ahupuaʻa of Kona, north enough that we were out of the evacuation zone. Soon after, the store was flooded with more people than I had ever seen before. Most were buying water and ice, but others had carts full of groceries. Customers sent me on errands to collect expensive liquor out of the cabinet and get them cigarettes, and joined the massive lines. Oddly enough, through the constant movement, I observed people being more patient than I'd ever seen them. We all seemed to accept what was going on– everyone equally had somewhere they would rather be. I operated with mounting panic and urgency, but also a sense of responsibility for the people there.",
				"Two additional managers had been called in to assist, with one regular cashier and five managers manning the front. I asked if we were going to close, something that had seemed inevitable as I tried to picture possibly working through an impending tsunami. When they said no, I thought resentfully of the cut hours, low budget, and decreased sales that the past few months have brought on. My heart crumpled a little as I tried to imagine having to do my other duties and beginning the lengthy process of balancing the store's books after spending the evening managing the crisis. One thing from the response was clear– the tsunami was good for business.",
				"After a mandated lunch period spent texting friends and family frantically and as we got closer to when the waves were supposed to hit, there were fewer people anxiously buying. Things changed over the next few hours in a way that shocked me. A haole college student, flashing me his ID as he bought drinks, politely asked how my day was going shortly after 7pm– I froze, not knowing what to say. Another haole man with an Australian accent joked “just one of those nights?” when I didn't respond to the same question a while later. Tourists had evacuated to the nearby park and the shopping center my store was in and filled the parking lot with their families and suitcases. The single stall public bathroom offered by our store had a winding line long into the evening. The cognitive dissonance wasn't exclusive to the tourists; an older couple, regular customers, approached me to ask if anything was going on, other than the tsunami. Meanwhile, I answered twenty identical phone calls as the night grew longer, and began to dread picking up the phone to people asking if we were staying open. All I wanted was to go home. During the rush as we awaited disaster, I hadn't really been upset by any of the grating interactions commonplace to high-stress situations and customer service work in general. In the aftermath, people's nonchalance confused and hurt me.",
				"In the next few days, the emotional divide occurring was stark. The next day was back to business as usual, and I was the one bringing it up in conversations. Speaking with family members, friends and coworkers, I heard about the time and energy people spent trying to get home. Coworkers and their families had also evacuated to the district park for the night. My coworker had told her adult niece and nephew, who were crying over the phone, to get to shelter without her so she could collect their pets. My aunty spent two hours in what would've been a fifteen minute drive trying to get to her daughter's workplace; other people abandoned their cars and started walking. Traffic was made worse by tourists trying to leave Waikīkī instead of sheltering in their hotels as advised and cruise ship guests who were transported by shuttle to shelters. If there were shuttles and buses ready to take residents rather than tourists to safety, much of the traffic jam could have been avoided. Additionally, most were told to leave work once the tsunami warning was issued no matter where they lived, but many service workers were not allowed to leave or were released long after the first warnings. 7-Elevens within the evacuation zone had lines out the door. Service workers, who are often treated the worst and paid the least, are expected to sacrifice their safety for profit during natural disasters. Worse was later learning that those who did stay in hotels were cheering when the waves were supposed to arrive, while complaining online that food service was suspended because the hotel workers were allowed to leave. They don't see service workers as people with families and lives, they only see their missed dinner and ruined vacation.",
				'It feels like an incredible miracle that people were safe, especially in the age of the climate crisis and resulting catastrophes that disproportionately affect marginalized populations, especially Native and working class people.  We must recognize that the capitalist, tourist economy prioritizes haole during emergencies and expects residents to make sacrifices for their comfort. I would gladly serve my community in a moment like this again, but am struggling in an aftermath that neglects the emergencies we have faced and that are to come.'

				'Howzit, readers and non-readers. As I am writing this, it is two days before the 183th Lā Hoʻi Hoʻi Ea, so I thought it would be a good idea to write about that. To anyone unfamiliar, Lā Hoʻi Hoʻi Ea is Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day, the real one, none of that July 4th bullshit. In 1882, British businessman Richard Charlton tried to claim Hawaiian lands. He did this by complaining to Captain George Paulet that he was being taken advantage of. This caused George Paulet to write a letter to King Kamehameha III saying that he demanded an audience with the king. After the two disagreed, Paulet threatened to launch a military attack on sovereign Hawaiian lands. Kamehameha III, knowing the strength of the British navy, made a diplomatic move by letting Paulet occupy Hawaii for the time being. Once word of this was sent back to Britain, they recognized this unlawful act. Britain sent Admiral Richard Thomas to reverse what Paulet had done and restore the Hawaiian Kingdom back to King Kamehameha III. King Kamehameha III declared the day of restoration a holiday, and it is one that many Hawaiians find great joy and pride in.',
				"This day, this history is an example of Hawaiian political actions that were never taught to us in public school. We all knew what the day was but we were never truly taught the history behind it, and that is exactly how the American Empire likes to keep it. They like us think that we are a bunch of people who rolled over whenever European countries tried to bully us, they like us believe that when the overthrow happened, we just wen give up. Fuck that. Stories like Lā Hoʻi Hoʻi Ea or the Kūʻē petitions are meant to be kept from us so that we don't realize that we Hawaiians are fucking fighters. We aren't no servile group who let colonization happen to us without a fight. The Hawaiians were politically savvy, on some realpolitik kine stuff. We recognized our political state and knew that the only way to survive was to be internationalists. We sent choke diplomats to Europe and across the world to secure recognition of our independence. We established relationships with our fellow Pacific nations. We studied the Empires of the day and tried to mimic them so that we could try and secure our own independence. People love to think that when colonization happened, we were just some people living in huts and then got colonized. The Hawaiians saw the writing on the wall, they saw all our cousins in the Pacific get overthrown, and they tried everything in their power to make sure that wouldn't happen to us. Unfortunately, Capitalism and Imperialism is a machine of death and decay that won't stop until every last one of us is either a slave or dead.",
				"I write this to you readers as a Hawaiian who never really knew his culture and history until recently. I was taught that nothing we did mattered and that all we can do is spit on the haoles, which I don't disagree with, but now I know that there are things we can do. We can take up the fight where our Kūpuna left off. We can destroy the American Empire and establish a real, sovereign, and socialist Hawaiʻi."

				"While I could write another piece about how American imperialism victimizes Hawaiʻi, at a certain point I am merely preaching to the choir. Most readers already understand the negative consequences of our economy's reliance on tourism, the military, and real estate on the land and people of Hawaiʻi. Even the common apolitical resident can recognize these harms. They watched as the Aloha Stadium parking lot filled to the brim with unused rental cars during the COVID shutdown. They feared for the health and safety of themselves and their children when Red Hill's jet fuel leaked into the water supply. They complain about soaring housing and rental costs and the worsening homelessness crisis. They see the chains that bind them, they may even recognize the systemic roots of these problems, yet few call for Hawaiian independence. So why is it that the vast majority cling to a system that endangers their safety and cripples them economically? I posit the reason is a lack of a clear alternative.",
				"As exploitative as American capitalism is to Hawaiʻi, it remains the system that feeds us and clothes us. In 2023, Hawaii received $11 billion more from the federal government than we paid to it, or nearly $7,000 per capita. Tourism, military and real estate, along with their various support industries sign the paycheck of a massive portion of the population. While sovereignty activists rightfully criticize the faults of this exploitative system, the masses who rely on it for survival are understandably skeptical about uprooting the system that puts food on their plates. So they merely complain, perhaps participate in a protest or two. However, most won't join a movement based on the fundamental idea of upsetting the status quo. If we wish to organize them, it is imperative to offer them a vision of how an independent Hawaiʻi would politically and economically benefit them.",
				'Discontent is a mighty hammer, yet left unguided it swings wildly in the dark. By failing to provide a clear path forward, we risk letting reactionaries harness this anger. This is how fascism is perpetuated: reactionaries take advantage of anger at a broken system and a powerless left opposition to create simple answers that appeal to the worst forms of bigotry to gain power. Without a defined ideology and alternative to the status quo, we cannot save our discontent neighbors from fascist thought, or expect to create a sustainable movement.',
				'So how do we create a vision for the future and develop an ideology? The answer is simple, we must share our thoughts, debate them, refine them, and allow them to evolve as we gain more perspectives. We cannot stay within our bubble, instead engage with the community and refine our theories by testing them in the real world. Through this process we can reimagine a future that will provide tangible political, economic, and cultural benefits. We cannot expect to theorize the perfect system for managing an independent Hawaiʻi, but we need to ease the doubts of the many who are sympathetic to our cause yet fearful of what they have to lose by uprooting the status quo. We must acknowledge their legitimate concerns and provide them a reason to want a revolution.'

				"As the American media attempts to sell Iran as the paramount “threat to peace” amid Israel's aggressive provocations in the Middle East, we witness a familiar script play out. China's activities in the South China Sea, Russia's intervention in Ukraine, the propaganda machine leverages public amnesia to replace last week's nemesis with this week's. But these nations don't realistically threaten American civilians, only the imperialist agenda of the American ruling class. After 9/11, American presidents were granted de facto war powers with the authorization to bypass Congress. And a formal declaration of war was absent from every military operation since WWII. So why the relentless media campaign to sell these conflicts to people with no voice in the matter? The answer is simple, fear breeds compliance. A terrified populace will tolerate eroding liberties, unchecked military spending, and endless wars, all to ward off the foreign boogeyman threatening “freedom and democracy”.",
				"After the fall of the USSR, America scrambled to find new enemies. And their answer came in the form of Al-Qaeda in the aftermath of 9/11. The media conflated Al-Qaeda with the Taliban to justify an invasion of Afghanistan, conveniently forgetting a decade of arming Afghan militants. After initial success, Iraq became the new “threat”, built on fabricated WMD claims and willful amnesia of past American support for Saddam Hussein. As these wars exposed their own pointlessness, the focus shifted to bigger powers. China's Belt and Road Initiative was smeared as “debt trap diplomacy” as the American-backed IMF enforced neoliberal exploitation. Headlines screamed of Russian interference in American elections while the CIA orchestrated coups across Latin America. Iran faced sanctions for hypothetical nuclear weapons, while America hoards a stockpile of over 3,000 nuclear warheads. This is not foreign policy, it is diversionary theater to mask empire-building with moral panic.",
				'So what is the cost of this machine? A staggering military budget of $866 billion rife with waste and fraud. In 2024, the Pentagon failed its seventh consecutive audit. And as a militarized colony, we suffer an additional burden. As American soldiers deplete our limited housing supply, traumatize our community with acts of violence and reckless endangerment, and engage in sex trafficking of the most vulnerable members of our society, we are expected to thank them for “protecting” us. We are supposed to accept the desecration of the land and poisoning of the water as a necessary evil to ward off the supposed Chinese menace. We are supposed to accept the constant threat of becoming collateral damage in the name of “national security”. How much longer must we endure this indignity?',
				"It is time for all of us to awaken and reject America's poisonous propaganda. China, Russia, and Iran bear no malice to the people of Hawaiʻi, only the exploitative American-centric world order that insists on using us as human shields. Claims that “others would've colonized us” ignore history. In the age of 19th century imperialism, Hawaiʻi enjoyed strong positive relations with the rest of the world. Both Japan and Britain declined the opportunity to turn Hawaiʻi into a protectorate. It was the only America that lusted for our location as a springboard into Asia. The American military presence only endangers Hawaiʻi, its people, and its land. It is therefore imperative that we reject American propaganda that antagonized China, Russia, Iran, and any other country. We can only cast off our chains when we awaken to recognize the true enemy: American imperialism and the insatiable beast known as the Military-Industrial Complex."

				"Over the past four days news of the protests against ICE raids and escalation by law enforcement and the federal government have been national headlines. We've been seeing for months now an increase in ICE raids and the level of force being used, separating and devastating families all over the country. Simultaneous ICE raids on Saturday, June 7, prompted responses from local residents to protect those in danger of being detained. LAPD and federal law enforcement responded with excessive violence that escalated the situation. The news coverage coming out of LA has been shocking, moreso because of the narrative the media has been spinning around violent mobs, rioting, and looting.",
				`ICE agents terrorize communities, racially profiling and indiscriminately detaining our families and children under false pretenses. They use plain clothes, unmarked vehicles, and lie to gain access to schools and homes without warrants, even going as far as abducting migrants showing up to required court hearings. On Monday, June 9th, in response to the brutality of the ICE raids, peaceful protests were coordinated across dozens of cities across the U.S. In LA, marches played well known Latino songs like "La Chona" and broke out into dance. At a protest in front of a hotel housing ICE, a live band made up of jornaleros (day laborers) played for the protestors. It's frustrating that the media refuses to cover the peaceful protests and the beautiful acts of solidarity, and instead fixate on isolated acts of property damage.`,
				'I have personal experience of working side-by-side with migrant day laborers who, during the Eaton and Altadena Fires, organized themselves into fire relief brigades. The Pasadena Workers Community Job Center distributed necessities and other aid to more than 30,000 people. We sweat our asses off  amid the smoke and pollution cleaning up debris. It is devastating and infuriating to be repaid with the destruction of our communities, heartbreak, violence, and broken families.',
				"I see a lot of people ask why migrants come to the U.S. if it's so dangerous for us. I can't speak for everyone, but I can speak to history and for my family. My family comes from El Salvador where a revolutionary war took place. All of the land in El Salvador was once owned by 16 European families who became rich off of their coffee plantations. The majority of the Indigenous Salvadoran people were not able to own land and they all worked on plantations picking coffee. They were called campesinos, peasant workers. There were multiple genocides that took place during these years where Indigenous Salvadorans practicing Indigenous culture, wearing traditional garments, speaking their native languages, or carrying a machete, were executed and buried in mass graves. Indigenous Salvadorans were forced to assimilate and work. There were several uprisings in El Salvador to liberate the campesinos and give the land back to the people, but the revolutionary war was the most significant. When Campesinos rose up to demand justice, the Salvadoran government, with the funding and supplying of weapons from the U.S., launched a brutal and bloody war.",
				"I find what most people don't know about migrants is that most of us come from countries like El Salvador where violence is perpetrated by the U.S. to protect profits. The U.S. is considered to be one of the richest and most successful countries in the world and this is achieved by the ravaging and destabilization of our home countries. The U.S. trained death squads in methods of torture and destabilization, armed them, and sent them to El Salvador. I know this because these same death squads came for my family and countless other families. My grandmother was assassinated in her kitchen by death squad members with U.S. assault rifles in her kitchen. They used her funeral to lure out her children. It was political persecution that forced my family to flee their homeland.",
				'This is how we know that the issue is not actually with us and our existence. The false narrative being pushed by mainstream media and the attempt to hide our real experience and contributions is intentional. This fight that is happening in LA is crucially important to Trump and the U.S. government. If the U.S. government can brutalize LA into compliance so they can abduct and terrorize black and brown and Indigenous people, they can do it anywhere. The U.S. government does not want to lose this fight, in the streets or in the media. However, black, brown, and Indigenous people in LA and the U.S.  have hundreds of years of history of being in solidarity and fighting alongside each other. We share a common oppressor.',
				"It's easy to think we are not affected here in Hawaiʻi. But the same government that oppresses and brutalizes on the continent, brutalizes and oppresses here too. This is the same government that illegally overthrew the Hawaiian Kingdom, uses its land for target practice, and contaminates its water. And this government is currently conducting ICE raids in Hawaiʻi and are showing up to our homes and places of work too. Just last month 30 Filipino teachers in Maui were detained.",
				"I want to ask, where is your humanity? We are workers, parents, and community members just like you. I don't have to tell you how every day we leave work tired, sweaty, and hurting, because you do too. I don't have to tell you about doing everything we can to put on the table and keep a roof over our heads because you do too. I don't have to tell you about how much we love our family and would do whatever we could to keep them safe and to provide for them, because you do too. We are the working class. We fight the same fight. Migrants are not the problem, but it is advantageous to the U.S. government to frame it as such. We are in a time of fascism where unity amongst the people is a danger to those wanting to generate wealth. Instead of blaming migrants for stealing jobs, ask why companies are exploiting migrant labor. Migrant labor is more profitable because they can be paid less and worked harder. Why should we live in a system that is designed to exploit our work to make a few people very comfortable?",
				"It is easy to be scared. It is easy to be hateful and to blame things on other vulnerable people. It's easy to be a coward. The biggest authority figure in our lives, our government, encourages it. It's so much harder to care. It's harder to love and it's harder to work through differences. Now is a time to be brave. Be brave and stand up for others. Connect with your friends and talk about what's happening. Educate yourselves and organize your communities."

				'The University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization (UHERO) has released their Hawaii Housing Factbook for 2025. The report begins with the statement that “Hawaii remains in a severe housing crisis” and goes on to paint a depressing picture of the state of affairs: “highest home prices in the nation […] nations highest homelessness rate […] fewer than one-in-four households could afford a mortgage on the median home,” and more. The problem and the solution UHERO offers can be summed up by this single sentence: “The success of housing policies depends most on their ability to increase the housing supply.” This analysis makes sense when you live within the bounds of a capitalist system.',
				'The state of housing that UHERO describes is not a list of the failures of the property market, but actually its successes. The median property value is close to $1,000,000. Housing is a commodity and its value is HIGH. Anyone who owns a home outright is part of a marketplace where the value of what you own is ensured to go up. This market builds an economy of landlords, developers, property managers, real estate agents and more. The developers want to build more houses cheaply, the landlords want to raise the rent and buy more property, the property managers want to lower costs (neglect maintenance) and increase their portfolio (more properties), and the real estate agents want whatever keeps this market open to trade. What they all need is a population of people desperate for that commodity: shelter, and not enough of it for everyone. And that my friends are YOU, the people who have no control over their housing.',
				'Marketplace renters, public housing residents, houseless folks on the street, YOU have always been in crisis from the moment a roof over your head was not a right but an item to be bought and sold. The state of housing that UHERO describes is a state of affairs for people who wish to one day buy a house, but they still want to keep YOU poor and desperate. The solutions thus, are a patchwork: developers advocate building more public housing, while getting rid of short term rentals and taxing vacant units only hurts a small fraction of real estate profiteers. Do this and what? YOU still scrounge for pennies and pay dollars to stay alive?',
				'True solutions exist outside the marketplace. Rent is a lie, financing the ruling class along with your labor. All of YOU are what keeps this system running. And all of YOU together can change it. What is needed is to change the conversation entirely. To center the needs of regular working class people. And that will only happen when YOU organize. The Honolulu Tenant Union exists as a structure to organize those who do not own or control their housing. When there is a majority of US together and strong, we can knock down this system with the simple truth that housing is a right!'

				"On Friday May 9th, Hawaiian activists and community organizations pressured the Board of Land and Natural Resources to reject the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the Pōhakuloa training area which, at over 100,000 acres, is the biggest US Department of Defense installation in the Pacific. At the meeting, the military claimed that they needed to retain that land for the “security of the Pacific”. What we need to do is read between the lines and ask the question, “Security for whom?” Is it the security of the land they are bombarding? Is it the security of the wildlife that they disrupt with the constant noise of explosions and gunfire? Is it the security of the people of Hawaiʻi, as contaminants seep into the land we grow food from and into the water we drink? The American military claims to mitigate their environmental impact with other programs or deal with the consequences later, but we've already seen how they resisted any accountability after jet fuel leaked into our drinking water at Red Hill. We need to recognize that the land that the military controls is not for the security of Hawaiʻi, but for the security of the American empire. Their recent actions only reinforce this notion.",
				"You may have heard the phrase “pivot to Asia” in the news. This means that the American empire wants to develop its military presence in Asia and the Pacific to intimidate China, which has developed at an incredible pace in the last century and started to threaten the US's global hegemony. China's rise threatens Western capital by providing an alternative to American imperialism through its diplomatic efforts, investments in the developing world, and strong economy independent of Western oligarchs. This contextualizes the recent actions the Trump administration has taken in international politics. Trump threatening to pull out of NATO in combination with fear mongering by the media puts pressure on European countries to spend more on their military to counter Russia. When the Signal chat with top military officials was leaked, the important part wasn't the security breach. It was the intent to scale back military aid to countries in West Asia and, in turn, the encouragement for US aligned countries to step up their military spending to counter Iran and Yemen. This allows the American military to shift their spending to Asia and the Pacific, all while offering a generous tax cut for the wealthy. The American empire's escalation of global tensions in the pursuit of economic dominance offers up millions of civilians around the world as collateral damage in the war they risk provoking. We cannot let ourselves be tricked into thinking that the Trump administration is irrational, but instead recognize that their actions purposely serve American capital at our expense.",
				'We therefore have a duty to reclaim land from the military not only for our safety, but for the safety of the whole of the Pacific. If the people of Hawaiʻi win back land for our own use, the US empire loses a key refueling station, training area, and site of military power projection. We can slow the militarization in the entirety of East Asia and the Pacific and fight back against American private investor capitalists and their dangerous new cold war. The leases for Pōhakuloa, Mākua and other sites will be up for renewal in 2029 and blocking the FEIS is only the first step in blocking the renewal entirely. We have less than 3 years, so there is no better time to get organized and involved in the struggle than now.'

				"For the past four months, President Donald Trump's national policy has plunged Hawaiʻi into turmoil through budget cuts, deportations, and international tariffs—despite the fact that only 37% of the state's voters supported him. Biden's administration spent four months defending the Red Hill tanks that poisoned our waters before public pressure forced their retreat. In the year and a half following Lahaina's catastrophic fires—a tragedy born of capitalist neglect—Biden lavishly allocated $12 billion to Zionist butchery in Gaza, while only a quarter of that was tossed to working people.",
				"Meanwhile, our economic autonomy is nonexistent. In service of Detroit's auto industry, we are forced to pay $30,000 for cars that could cost less than half that from BYD. Speculators from the continent—who accounted for 23% of Hawaiʻi's property sales last year—continuously drive up housing costs, yet we remain constitutionally barred from curbing their speculation. Even during COVID-19's peak, Trump disregarded public health and refused to restrict non-essential travel to the islands, causing hundreds of unnecessary deaths.",
				'The root of this marginalization is clear: Hawaiʻi holds negligible political power in the American system. We comprise just 0.4% of the U.S. population, contribute 0.3% of its GDP, 0.5% of House votes, and 0.7% of electoral college power. Unlike states like Nebraska or New Hampshire, which ally with regional neighbors, we stand isolated in the Pacific with no natural coalition. Statehood itself was a farce, a concession granted only once Washington knew we could never defy its hegemony.',
				"In practice, we remain a colony at the mercy of American oligarchs pulling the strings of their Democrat and Republican puppets. Federal income taxes drain our resources, only to be weaponized as “funding” that coerces compliance with Washington's demands. We do not influence national politics, we receive decrees from our imperial overlords. The time has come to declare: Affairs east of Hilo are foreign affairs. We must view Washington as the Global South does—a predatory empire to be resisted, not obeyed.",
				"To break this cycle, Hawaiʻi must pursue true self-determination. We cannot remain reliant on federal funds and shackled by federal taxes. The state must reclaim responsibility for services stripped by budget cuts, prioritize local self-sufficiency, and build grassroots power to address local needs. Independence won't be won in the Washington swamp but through collective action here at home."
