				"As the American media attempts to sell Iran as the paramount “threat to peace” amid Israel's aggressive provocations in the Middle East, we witness a familiar script play out. China's activities in the South China Sea, Russia's intervention in Ukraine, the propaganda machine leverages public amnesia to replace last week's nemesis with this week's. But these nations don't realistically threaten American civilians, only the imperialist agenda of the American ruling class. After 9/11, American presidents were granted de facto war powers with the authorization to bypass Congress. And a formal declaration of war was absent from every military operation since WWII. So why the relentless media campaign to sell these conflicts to people with no voice in the matter? The answer is simple, fear breeds compliance. A terrified populace will tolerate eroding liberties, unchecked military spending, and endless wars, all to ward off the foreign boogeyman threatening “freedom and democracy”.",
				"After the fall of the USSR, America scrambled to find new enemies. And their answer came in the form of Al-Qaeda in the aftermath of 9/11. The media conflated Al-Qaeda with the Taliban to justify an invasion of Afghanistan, conveniently forgetting a decade of arming Afghan militants. After initial success, Iraq became the new “threat”, built on fabricated WMD claims and willful amnesia of past American support for Saddam Hussein. As these wars exposed their own pointlessness, the focus shifted to bigger powers. China's Belt and Road Initiative was smeared as “debt trap diplomacy” as the American-backed IMF enforced neoliberal exploitation. Headlines screamed of Russian interference in American elections while the CIA orchestrated coups across Latin America. Iran faced sanctions for hypothetical nuclear weapons, while America hoards a stockpile of over 3,000 nuclear warheads. This is not foreign policy, it is diversionary theater to mask empire-building with moral panic.",
				'So what is the cost of this machine? A staggering military budget of $866 billion rife with waste and fraud. In 2024, the Pentagon failed its seventh consecutive audit. And as a militarized colony, we suffer an additional burden. As American soldiers deplete our limited housing supply, traumatize our community with acts of violence and reckless endangerment, and engage in sex trafficking of the most vulnerable members of our society, we are expected to thank them for “protecting” us. We are supposed to accept the desecration of the land and poisoning of the water as a necessary evil to ward off the supposed Chinese menace. We are supposed to accept the constant threat of becoming collateral damage in the name of “national security”. How much longer must we endure this indignity?',
				"It is time for all of us to awaken and reject America's poisonous propaganda. China, Russia, and Iran bear no malice to the people of Hawaiʻi, only the exploitative American-centric world order that insists on using us as human shields. Claims that “others would've colonized us” ignore history. In the age of 19th century imperialism, Hawaiʻi enjoyed strong positive relations with the rest of the world. Both Japan and Britain declined the opportunity to turn Hawaiʻi into a protectorate. It was the only America that lusted for our location as a springboard into Asia. The American military presence only endangers Hawaiʻi, its people, and its land. It is therefore imperative that we reject American propaganda that antagonized China, Russia, Iran, and any other country. We can only cast off our chains when we awaken to recognize the true enemy: American imperialism and the insatiable beast known as the Military-Industrial Complex."

				"Over the past four days news of the protests against ICE raids and escalation by law enforcement and the federal government have been national headlines. We've been seeing for months now an increase in ICE raids and the level of force being used, separating and devastating families all over the country. Simultaneous ICE raids on Saturday, June 7, prompted responses from local residents to protect those in danger of being detained. LAPD and federal law enforcement responded with excessive violence that escalated the situation. The news coverage coming out of LA has been shocking, moreso because of the narrative the media has been spinning around violent mobs, rioting, and looting.",
				`ICE agents terrorize communities, racially profiling and indiscriminately detaining our families and children under false pretenses. They use plain clothes, unmarked vehicles, and lie to gain access to schools and homes without warrants, even going as far as abducting migrants showing up to required court hearings. On Monday, June 9th, in response to the brutality of the ICE raids, peaceful protests were coordinated across dozens of cities across the U.S. In LA, marches played well known Latino songs like "La Chona" and broke out into dance. At a protest in front of a hotel housing ICE, a live band made up of jornaleros (day laborers) played for the protestors. It's frustrating that the media refuses to cover the peaceful protests and the beautiful acts of solidarity, and instead fixate on isolated acts of property damage.`,
				'I have personal experience of working side-by-side with migrant day laborers who, during the Eaton and Altadena Fires, organized themselves into fire relief brigades. The Pasadena Workers Community Job Center distributed necessities and other aid to more than 30,000 people. We sweat our asses off  amid the smoke and pollution cleaning up debris. It is devastating and infuriating to be repaid with the destruction of our communities, heartbreak, violence, and broken families.',
				"I see a lot of people ask why migrants come to the U.S. if it's so dangerous for us. I can't speak for everyone, but I can speak to history and for my family. My family comes from El Salvador where a revolutionary war took place. All of the land in El Salvador was once owned by 16 European families who became rich off of their coffee plantations. The majority of the Indigenous Salvadoran people were not able to own land and they all worked on plantations picking coffee. They were called campesinos, peasant workers. There were multiple genocides that took place during these years where Indigenous Salvadorans practicing Indigenous culture, wearing traditional garments, speaking their native languages, or carrying a machete, were executed and buried in mass graves. Indigenous Salvadorans were forced to assimilate and work. There were several uprisings in El Salvador to liberate the campesinos and give the land back to the people, but the revolutionary war was the most significant. When Campesinos rose up to demand justice, the Salvadoran government, with the funding and supplying of weapons from the U.S., launched a brutal and bloody war.",
				"I find what most people don't know about migrants is that most of us come from countries like El Salvador where violence is perpetrated by the U.S. to protect profits. The U.S. is considered to be one of the richest and most successful countries in the world and this is achieved by the ravaging and destabilization of our home countries. The U.S. trained death squads in methods of torture and destabilization, armed them, and sent them to El Salvador. I know this because these same death squads came for my family and countless other families. My grandmother was assassinated in her kitchen by death squad members with U.S. assault rifles in her kitchen. They used her funeral to lure out her children. It was political persecution that forced my family to flee their homeland.",
				'This is how we know that the issue is not actually with us and our existence. The false narrative being pushed by mainstream media and the attempt to hide our real experience and contributions is intentional. This fight that is happening in LA is crucially important to Trump and the U.S. government. If the U.S. government can brutalize LA into compliance so they can abduct and terrorize black and brown and Indigenous people, they can do it anywhere. The U.S. government does not want to lose this fight, in the streets or in the media. However, black, brown, and Indigenous people in LA and the U.S.  have hundreds of years of history of being in solidarity and fighting alongside each other. We share a common oppressor.',
				"It's easy to think we are not affected here in Hawaiʻi. But the same government that oppresses and brutalizes on the continent, brutalizes and oppresses here too. This is the same government that illegally overthrew the Hawaiian Kingdom, uses its land for target practice, and contaminates its water. And this government is currently conducting ICE raids in Hawaiʻi and are showing up to our homes and places of work too. Just last month 30 Filipino teachers in Maui were detained.",
				"I want to ask, where is your humanity? We are workers, parents, and community members just like you. I don't have to tell you how every day we leave work tired, sweaty, and hurting, because you do too. I don't have to tell you about doing everything we can to put on the table and keep a roof over our heads because you do too. I don't have to tell you about how much we love our family and would do whatever we could to keep them safe and to provide for them, because you do too. We are the working class. We fight the same fight. Migrants are not the problem, but it is advantageous to the U.S. government to frame it as such. We are in a time of fascism where unity amongst the people is a danger to those wanting to generate wealth. Instead of blaming migrants for stealing jobs, ask why companies are exploiting migrant labor. Migrant labor is more profitable because they can be paid less and worked harder. Why should we live in a system that is designed to exploit our work to make a few people very comfortable?",
				"It is easy to be scared. It is easy to be hateful and to blame things on other vulnerable people. It's easy to be a coward. The biggest authority figure in our lives, our government, encourages it. It's so much harder to care. It's harder to love and it's harder to work through differences. Now is a time to be brave. Be brave and stand up for others. Connect with your friends and talk about what's happening. Educate yourselves and organize your communities."

				'The University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization (UHERO) has released their Hawaii Housing Factbook for 2025. The report begins with the statement that “Hawaii remains in a severe housing crisis” and goes on to paint a depressing picture of the state of affairs: “highest home prices in the nation […] nations highest homelessness rate […] fewer than one-in-four households could afford a mortgage on the median home,” and more. The problem and the solution UHERO offers can be summed up by this single sentence: “The success of housing policies depends most on their ability to increase the housing supply.” This analysis makes sense when you live within the bounds of a capitalist system.',
				'The state of housing that UHERO describes is not a list of the failures of the property market, but actually its successes. The median property value is close to $1,000,000. Housing is a commodity and its value is HIGH. Anyone who owns a home outright is part of a marketplace where the value of what you own is ensured to go up. This market builds an economy of landlords, developers, property managers, real estate agents and more. The developers want to build more houses cheaply, the landlords want to raise the rent and buy more property, the property managers want to lower costs (neglect maintenance) and increase their portfolio (more properties), and the real estate agents want whatever keeps this market open to trade. What they all need is a population of people desperate for that commodity: shelter, and not enough of it for everyone. And that my friends are YOU, the people who have no control over their housing.',
				'Marketplace renters, public housing residents, houseless folks on the street, YOU have always been in crisis from the moment a roof over your head was not a right but an item to be bought and sold. The state of housing that UHERO describes is a state of affairs for people who wish to one day buy a house, but they still want to keep YOU poor and desperate. The solutions thus, are a patchwork: developers advocate building more public housing, while getting rid of short term rentals and taxing vacant units only hurts a small fraction of real estate profiteers. Do this and what? YOU still scrounge for pennies and pay dollars to stay alive?',
				'True solutions exist outside the marketplace. Rent is a lie, financing the ruling class along with your labor. All of YOU are what keeps this system running. And all of YOU together can change it. What is needed is to change the conversation entirely. To center the needs of regular working class people. And that will only happen when YOU organize. The Honolulu Tenant Union exists as a structure to organize those who do not own or control their housing. When there is a majority of US together and strong, we can knock down this system with the simple truth that housing is a right!'

				"On Friday May 9th, Hawaiian activists and community organizations pressured the Board of Land and Natural Resources to reject the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the Pōhakuloa training area which, at over 100,000 acres, is the biggest US Department of Defense installation in the Pacific. At the meeting, the military claimed that they needed to retain that land for the “security of the Pacific”. What we need to do is read between the lines and ask the question, “Security for whom?” Is it the security of the land they are bombarding? Is it the security of the wildlife that they disrupt with the constant noise of explosions and gunfire? Is it the security of the people of Hawaiʻi, as contaminants seep into the land we grow food from and into the water we drink? The American military claims to mitigate their environmental impact with other programs or deal with the consequences later, but we've already seen how they resisted any accountability after jet fuel leaked into our drinking water at Red Hill. We need to recognize that the land that the military controls is not for the security of Hawaiʻi, but for the security of the American empire. Their recent actions only reinforce this notion.",
				"You may have heard the phrase “pivot to Asia” in the news. This means that the American empire wants to develop its military presence in Asia and the Pacific to intimidate China, which has developed at an incredible pace in the last century and started to threaten the US's global hegemony. China's rise threatens Western capital by providing an alternative to American imperialism through its diplomatic efforts, investments in the developing world, and strong economy independent of Western oligarchs. This contextualizes the recent actions the Trump administration has taken in international politics. Trump threatening to pull out of NATO in combination with fear mongering by the media puts pressure on European countries to spend more on their military to counter Russia. When the Signal chat with top military officials was leaked, the important part wasn't the security breach. It was the intent to scale back military aid to countries in West Asia and, in turn, the encouragement for US aligned countries to step up their military spending to counter Iran and Yemen. This allows the American military to shift their spending to Asia and the Pacific, all while offering a generous tax cut for the wealthy. The American empire’s escalation of global tensions in the pursuit of economic dominance offers up millions of civilians around the world as collateral damage in the war they risk provoking. We cannot let ourselves be tricked into thinking that the Trump administration is irrational, but instead recognize that their actions purposely serve American capital at our expense.",
				'We therefore have a duty to reclaim land from the military not only for our safety, but for the safety of the whole of the Pacific. If the people of Hawaiʻi win back land for our own use, the US empire loses a key refueling station, training area, and site of military power projection. We can slow the militarization in the entirety of East Asia and the Pacific and fight back against American private investor capitalists and their dangerous new cold war. The leases for Pōhakuloa, Mākua and other sites will be up for renewal in 2029 and blocking the FEIS is only the first step in blocking the renewal entirely. We have less than 3 years, so there is no better time to get organized and involved in the struggle than now.'

			paragraphs: [
				"For the past four months, President Donald Trump's national policy has plunged Hawaiʻi into turmoil through budget cuts, deportations, and international tariffs—despite the fact that only 37% of the state's voters supported him. Biden's administration spent four months defending the Red Hill tanks that poisoned our waters before public pressure forced their retreat. In the year and a half following Lahaina's catastrophic fires—a tragedy born of capitalist neglect—Biden lavishly allocated $12 billion to Zionist butchery in Gaza, while only a quarter of that was tossed to working people.",
				"Meanwhile, our economic autonomy is nonexistent. In service of Detroit's auto industry, we are forced to pay $30,000 for cars that could cost less than half that from BYD. Speculators from the continent—who accounted for 23% of Hawaiʻi's property sales last year—continuously drive up housing costs, yet we remain constitutionally barred from curbing their speculation. Even during COVID-19's peak, Trump disregarded public health and refused to restrict non-essential travel to the islands, causing hundreds of unnecessary deaths.",
				'The root of this marginalization is clear: Hawaiʻi holds negligible political power in the American system. We comprise just 0.4% of the U.S. population, contribute 0.3% of its GDP, 0.5% of House votes, and 0.7% of electoral college power. Unlike states like Nebraska or New Hampshire, which ally with regional neighbors, we stand isolated in the Pacific with no natural coalition. Statehood itself was a farce, a concession granted only once Washington knew we could never defy its hegemony.',
				"In practice, we remain a colony at the mercy of American oligarchs pulling the strings of their Democrat and Republican puppets. Federal income taxes drain our resources, only to be weaponized as “funding” that coerces compliance with Washington's demands. We do not influence national politics, we receive decrees from our imperial overlords. The time has come to declare: Affairs east of Hilo are foreign affairs. We must view Washington as the Global South does—a predatory empire to be resisted, not obeyed.",
				"To break this cycle, Hawaiʻi must pursue true self-determination. We cannot remain reliant on federal funds and shackled by federal taxes. The state must reclaim responsibility for services stripped by budget cuts, prioritize local self-sufficiency, and build grassroots power to address local needs. Independence won't be won in the Washington swamp but through collective action here at home."
