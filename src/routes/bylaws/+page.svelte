<ol class="text-left text-sm mb-4 list-decimal pl-12">
	<li class="">
		Our mission is to aid in educating, organizing, and liberating the people and ʻāina of Kō
		Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina and to play a helpful and principled role in the movement for liberation
		throughout Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina and the world. Within and throughout this struggle, we will
		articulate, defend, and advance the idea that liberation is impossible under capitalism and de
		facto political attachment to the United States of America. We seek to help effect change which
		would extend democracy into all aspects of life—social, political, economic, and environmental.
		This is the struggle for socialism. Our vision of socialism is profoundly democratic, feminist,
		de-colonial, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist.
