	Within and throughout this struggle, we will articulate, defend, and advance the idea that
	liberation is impossible under capitalism and de facto political attachment to the United States

	We seek to help effect change which would extend democracy into all aspects of life—social,
	political, economic, and environmental. This is the struggle for socialism. Our vision of
	socialism is profoundly democratic, feminist, de-colonial, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist.
