<p class="text-center"><b>Our mission is to aid in educating, organizing, and liberating the people and ʻāina of Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina and to play a helpful and principled role in the movement for liberation throughout Kō Hawaiʻi Pae ʻĀina and the world.</b></p>
<p class="text-center">Within and throughout this struggle, we will articulate, defend, and advance the idea that liberation is impossible under capitalism and de facto political attachment to the United States of America.</p>
<p class="text-center">We seek to help effect change which would extend democracy into all aspects of life—social, political, economic, and environmental. This is the struggle for socialism. Our vision of socialism is profoundly democratic, feminist, de-colonial, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist.</p>
